# Ciclo Seguro
This project is an app called 'Ciclo Seguro,' translating from Portuguese to 'Safe Cycle.' 
It targets primarily women who are victims of domestic violence from their partners or who seek quick assistance in case of emergency.

The app interface revolves around menstrual cycle tracking, with key features including cycle registration, symptoms tracking, and flow intensity. It also offers data insights such as upcoming, fertile, and delayed periods.

The 'Report' feature is activated by pressing a button located at the center of the main screen for 3 seconds. This action changes the page text content to inform the user that if they are in an emergency, the police will receive a report containing live location, device audio, and profile information. To confirm, the button must be pressed for 3 seconds again, returning the app to its cycle tracking functionality.
